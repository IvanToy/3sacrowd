# How to Play

**Directions**: The objective of 3sacrowd is to place an alien tile in every empty square in order to 
**fill the entire board**. But be careful! You must **<font size="3" color="FF0000">avoid having three adjacent tiles of the same color in any direction</font>**--
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Aliens need their space! 

When all the empty tiles have been occupied, <font size="3" color="#00FF00">you win</font>!

Some tiles will be fixed and you will not be allowed to place an alien at that location. However, you may use these to your advantage. Because sometimes **creativity needs constraints**. ;-)

The game is entirely developed with [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/). [RequireJs](http://requirejs.org/) is used for modularization. The purpose of this project is to **learn** so **anybody is welcome**. Are you looking for an easy javascript project to make your first [contribution](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/) on GitHub? **This may be the one!**

### To write and run the tests:

1. Clone/Download the code from this repository.
![Clone/Download example](https://i.imgur.com/2ikwsFE.png)
2. Install the pre-requisites:  
   Run `npm install` in your terminal.
3. Make any changes as you feel necessary.
4. To run all tests, run `npm run allTests` in your terminal.
   To run a specific test, run `npm run [testName]` in your terminal.
   For example to run the test located in test/infoTest.js run `npm run infoTest`
5. Any test added, should have a test script added to the `package.json` file in the root directory, using the same naming conventions, `node /test/[testName.js]`.
